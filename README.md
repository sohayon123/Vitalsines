# Vitalsines
 
During my time as a co-op student at Vitalsines, I was responsible for the design and assembly of a variety of mechanical and electrical projects, however, the main project that I worked on was a device with the objective of measuring pulse wave velocity in a comfortable and easy way. 

## PCB Design
I developed 3 different PCBs for this project, one for filtering incoming data from piezo sensors of my design, one for aggregating sensor data lines, and one for sending this data to a DAQ. These PCBs were extremely small, at only 2cm diameter, and were assembled by hand. They contained a adjustable low pass filter to get rid of some of the noise in the analog signal from the piezo. The component size for this PCB was 0603 and the board was designed to have 4 layers, one ground plane and one 10V power plane, to help clean up the traces.

## Mechanical Design

The mechanical design involved creating a strap that would host all of the electronics and sit comfortably on the chest. It also involved the design of some enclosures for the piezo sensors. Below are some pictures of the final result and some of the CAD files. The strap was designed with some areas of varying thickness to allow the PCBs to clip directly into the prototype strap. There were some cavities left in the strap as well to accomodate the various sensor cables.
